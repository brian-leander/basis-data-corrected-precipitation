# Skeleton property file for a project using the DMI/VU autobuild
# system.
# The properties used include the jdk property used to specify
# the jdk used for this project. The jdk property may be
# shortened or omitted in which case the newest available jdk
# will be used.
# When a project is branched/released the exact jdk version used
# must be specified.
# Other properties are specified to show wich libraries the project
# depends on. There are 3 different kinds of dependencies:

# 1:
# dependencies=<project1>=<version1> <project2>=<version2> ... <projectN>=<versionN>
# These are "normal" dependencies. The specified projects are used when
# compiling AND distributed when generating packages

# 2:
# dependencies.compile=<project1>=<version1> <project2>=<version2> ... <projectN>=<versionN>
# Special case: The specified projects are used when compiling but NOT
# distributed when generating packages. An example for use of this is a
# servlet, where you need the servlet jar to compile, but you should not
# distribute the servlet jar to the server since the jar is part of the
# tomcat.

# 3:
# dependencies.run=<project1>=<version1> <project2>=<version2> ... <projectN>=<versionN>
# Special case: The specified projects NOT required when compiling but 
# must be distributed when generating packages. An example for use of 
# this could be a database driver like mysql.jar or postgresql.jar.

# The versions may be "main" while developing. This is convenient when 
# changing code both in the project and in a library.
# Note that when the project is released all main versions must be
# replaced by exact versions. This means that you will have to release
# the libraries before the project itself.
